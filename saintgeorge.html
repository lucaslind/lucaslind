      <p>Saint-George Hotel:<br>The Politics of Non-Erasure<br>2015</p>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <p>The project attempts to analyze the complex history of post-war reconstruction and production of space in Beirut. The project focuses on the processes of accumulation and collection in two post-destruction reconstruction projects, Haret Hreik in the southern suburb and the Central District. The research culminates in a proposal for the vacant Saint-George Hotel.</p>
      <p>The city of Beirut has many layers of urban history. The creation of Greater Lebanon in 1920 under the French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon transformed Beirut from a city-state occupied mainly by merchants to the capital of a territory with many different groups. The migration of these diverse groups to the capital gave rise to new sectarian and religious relations and tensions. The city center underwent a number of spatial transformations around this period. In the late 19th century, the Ottoman leadership constructed Martyrs’ Square to the east and a formalized souk to the north. After the French Mandate, French authorities cut Hausmann-esque avenues through the center’s medieval Arab fabric. Though mixing between different groups occurred throughout the city, the center was perhaps the best example of a “neutral” space bordered by many subgroups but not controlled by any one group. Existing as a “border between different communities,” the center served as both “separator or buffer between rival communities,” and “their meeting place.”<sup>1</sup>  While other neighborhoods saw intensification of inhabitants with matching affiliations, the center was used by all denominations and defied control by individual groups. </p>
      <p>Martyrs’ Square was emblematic of this condition and served a variety of functions. The square was a commemorative space, an entertainment center, and a transportation hub.<sup>2</sup>  Martyrs’ Square and the immediate area contained cinemas, theaters, cafes, restaurants, hotels, nightclubs, the main bus and tram terminals, and a public square. Though it admittedly catered to a secular and international clientele, it nevertheless functioned as a neutral and inclusive common space in the city.During the civil war, the Central District became a no man’s land for the same reasons it had been a buffer zone before the war.  Martyrs’ Square was one of the first spaces to become a battlefield. Families fled the center and moved to the north and to the south of the city, and the city became divided between the mostly Christian east and the mostly Muslim west. Schools, business, and government offices were often split into two, with half on each side of the city. Public space suffered from this arrangement. Rather than function as inclusive common spaces, open spaces strictly serviced their respective communities and did not facilitate inter-communal interaction.  Moreover, the Central District’s “disappearance from the daily life of the Lebanese since the mid ‘70s polarized public life in the city .” <sup>3</sup></p>
      <p>The civil war left the city center overwhelmingly destroyed. The Saint-George hotel, which had been a destination for the international jet-setting community from its construction in 1929 until the civil war, went up in flames in the Battle of the Hotels. The devastation of the center, combined with infrastructural damage, complex property rights, and a weak government made individual and governmental efforts to rebuild ineffective. Solidere, a private company, was founded to undertake reconstruction. Some claim that Rafiq Hariri and others who would be involved in the creation of Solidere were responsible for demolishing up to 45% of the buildings in the Central District during the civil war, while actual combat destroyed only 35% of the buildings.<sup>4</sup> Through a process of expropriation, Solidere gave property owners stringent requirements to rebuild or else exchange their land for shares in Solidere. In a process that erased individual claims on space, the territory was almost completely erased to tabula rasa, and thereby defined as pure commodity. While Solidere rebuilt much of the center in the face of many obstacles, its primary concern as a private company was inevitably the accumulation of capital. The territory of the current center has been reconfigured for the flow of global capital and essentially has failed as a mediator among Lebanese. Furthermore, Solidere was selective in decisions to retain religious buildings and erase modernist buildings, modifying the city’s spatial history as one formed primarily by religious and sectarian forces.</p>
      <p>In the process of expropriation, Solidere obtained most of the waqfs, or properties dedicated to the God and thereby excluded from the market according to Islamic law. Solidere made a distinction between religious waqfs–properties with actual mosques or churches–and non-religious waqfs–properties containing any number of types which might benefit a mosque through rent or social programs. At the same time, Solidere removed any sort of infill construction and programming that was integrated with the religious structures. The process transformed the understanding of mosques into monuments instead of spaces integrated with the economy of daily life. In other words, the infill was removed from the icon.</p>
      <p>While Solidere reconstructed a number of buildings, they erased and completely redesigned many others. One such example is the commercial complex known as the Beirut Souks built on the site of the former souks, which were damaged more by demolitions during the war than by fighting and salvageable at the end of it but nevertheless demolished by Solidere. The Souks were reconstructed on the ancient city grid–though the ground had been excavated to create underground parking–and street names were maintained along with a number of monuments. Rather than recognize the project as something new–a luxury mall on the site of the old souks–Solidere exploited memory as a marketing opportunity.</p>
      <p>Zaitunay Bay is a mixed-use project on the waterfront to the northwest of the Beirut Souks. Though the project sits in between two public spaces–the sidewalk and the boardwalk–posted signs point out that the property itself is not public. Despite the project’s attempt to attract a certain type of public, its proximity to the Corniche brings in many types of Beirutis. The Corniche is a waterfront area with a number of small vendors and is perhaps the only remaining example in Beirut of a neutral common space that all types of people come and inhabit. However, the mixing essentially occurs only at dawn for exercise and without social or economic exchange. After the war, Solidere cleared Martyr’s Square except for a few buildings and the commemorative statue. Excavations uncovered historic ruins and today much of the space is used as a parking lot. In 2005 and 2007 it became the site of massive political protests, first anti-Syrian, then anti-government. The proximity of the protests to the city center contributed to the increasing emptiness of the center.
</p>
      <p>Hezbollah reconstructed Haret Hreik, a neighborhood in the southern part of the city, after the 2006 Isreali war and bombing that left 265 buildings destroyed and over 1300 damaged.<sup>5</sup> The quick on-site resettlement was a landmark in the history of the city, something the weak central government has never been able to accomplish. 90% of dwellers delegated responsibility to Hezbollah for the reconstruction and the project was praised as an alternative to the Solidere model of reconstruction. However, in order to reconstruct so quickly, Hezbollah prioritized “memory of place” to rebuild the neighborhood as close to how it was before as possible even though the neighborhood had problems like traffic, and lack of sidewalks and playgrounds.<sup>6</sup>  Most improvements were in the private space of the dwellings: generators, elevators, safety. The reconstruction neglected common space (for fear of misuse of such spaces) and held private property to be the most important metric of value. The project reduced a complex spatial history to an aggregate of individual property claims.  Furthermore, while ostensibly a participatory planning process, the dwellers had little input other than some interior finishes. The project has had similar effects on the space of daily life as has neoliberal planning.
</p>
      <p>Since the war, the owner of the Saint-George hotel has attempted to reconstruct only be have efforts consistently thwarted by Solidere. In 2001, Solidere took control of the marina around the Saint-George and built a seawall, effectively erasing the hotel’s waterfront access. The hotel has become a symbol against Solidere and today serves as a buffer zone between Solidere/not Solidere/the Corniche, and Zaitunay Bay.</p>

      <p style="font-weight:bold">Proposal:</p>
      <p>The proposal for the Saint-Geoge attempts to replace some of the city’s lost texture, using the program of the pre-war Martyrs’ Square as a model to recreate a neutral but active meeting and memorial space. The project proposes reintroducing the infill to the icon and weaving them together. The icon is the building as a symbol of pre and post-war Beirut and as a site of activism against Solidere. The active infill is an open air souq market dedicated as a waqf that serves as an autonomous zone where people come together despite affiliation. The program also includes entertainment (restaurants, cafés, a cinema, and a nightclub), a public square, a bus station, and a hotel.</p>
      <p>Interventions are treated as volumes that intersect the existing structure, creating inhabitable spaces and preserving parts of the destroyed façade. Moments where active programs intersect the damage wall put the project in contrast with the fantasy of erasure in the facing Zaitunay Bay project. The preserved wall functions as both a memorial to Hariri and as a didactic apparatus about the conflict. </p>
      <p>The souk is brought through the ground level of the Saint-George to create a continuous fabric. The shifted volume on the second floor serves as a lobby. A restaurant and café are in the interstitial spaces. The spiral staircase is the main form of circulation apart from the elevator. Visitors and hotel guests circle in and out of the damaged façade, looking out to the city through the damage, seeing the site of the bomb blast, then looking back at the wall from the outside, seeing it in the context of the building. At the top level, the volume allows you to see out from a vantage point used in the battle of the hotels in the context of new high-rise hotels. The upper level also allows views out to the central district, the old shoreline walk, and Zaitunay Bay.</p>
      <p>The shifted grid continues as a framework for the hotel rooms, which therefore shift to look away from what was sea and coastline but is now Zaitunay Bay and out towards the sea. Active programs, public space, circulation, and economic activity are all woven into space for contemplation and non-erasure of a complex and difficult history.</p>
